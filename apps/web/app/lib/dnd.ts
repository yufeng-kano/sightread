/**
 * The three things HTML5 drag events do not tell you on their own (docs/web.md § Files).
 *
 * **What is being dragged.** `dataTransfer.getData` is empty during a drag — the payload
 * only becomes readable on drop, by design, so a page cannot read what you are dragging
 * over it. `types` is readable throughout, which is how a drag from the desktop is told
 * apart from a row of this page.
 *
 * **Who is handling it.** `dragover` fires on the element under the pointer and bubbles all
 * the way to the window, so several handlers see the same event and each would happily
 * decide the drop is theirs. A claim marks the event on the way up: the innermost handler
 * that wants it takes it, and everything above reads the mark instead of guessing.
 *
 * The claim is also what replaces `dragleave` for un-highlighting a drop target. `dragleave`
 * fires for every child element the pointer crosses and bubbles like everything else, so a
 * row built from a caret and a label reports "left" halfway across itself; browsers also
 * disagree about whether `relatedTarget` is populated on drag events. `dragover` has none of
 * that ambiguity — it fires continuously on exactly one innermost element — so the window
 * clears whatever the last `dragover` did not claim.
 *
 * The claims live in a `WeakMap` keyed by the event object: an event is over in a frame, and
 * nothing here should keep one alive.
