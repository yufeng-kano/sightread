/**
 * The touch half of "right-click for actions" (docs/web.md § Files).
 *
 * A pointer held still on a row for half a second is the same gesture as a right-click, and
 * on a phone it is the only one there is. Three details are what make it feel native rather
 * than accidental:
 *
 *  - **A mouse is not involved.** It has a right button, and `contextmenu` is a better event
 *    than any timer — so a mouse press starts nothing here.
 *  - **A drag is not a press.** Moving past a few pixels is a scroll or a drag, and both must
 *    cancel the hold rather than open a menu under a finger that has left.
 *  - **The click that follows is eaten.** The browser still sends one when the finger lifts,
 *    and a long press on a document would otherwise open the result viewer behind its own
 *    menu. `onClickCapture` runs before the row's own button and stops it.
 *
 * One instance serves a whole screen: only one finger can be holding at a time, so the state
 * is shared and the row is whatever `on()` closed over.
