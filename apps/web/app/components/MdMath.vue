/* The formula keeps the body's colour; wider than the measure, it scrolls in place like a

   Sideways *only*. `overflow-y` is stated rather than left alone because CSS computes a
   `visible` axis to `auto` as soon as the other one is not — so `overflow-x: auto` alone
   hands a tall `\begin{cases}` a vertical scrollbar and shows half of it. The block has no
   height of its own, so hiding that axis expands to the formula instead of clipping it; the
   vertical padding is slack for the fraction bars and accents KaTeX draws a pixel or two
   outside its own box. */
