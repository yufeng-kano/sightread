"""Job execution: one document, page by page (docs/jobs.md, docs/parsing.md).

Shape of a run: read the job, resolve the user's key, work out the pages, then fan the
pages out. Poppler work is bounded by the worker-wide render semaphore; upstream calls are
bounded by this job's own vision budget, which halves itself when OpenRouter says 429.

Page failures are page-scoped by design: an unreadable page becomes an entry in `errors`
and the rest of the document still parses. Only a document where no page survived, a dead
key, or exhausted credits ends the whole job.
