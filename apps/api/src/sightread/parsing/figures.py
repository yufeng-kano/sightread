"""Figure crop persistence (docs/parsing.md § Figure crops).

Crops are taken from the rendered page image at the one moment it exists — right after the
vision call, before retention deletes it — and written under the job's own directory in
`FIGURES_DIR`, named by the page and the cleaned bbox. That name is exactly what a
`sightread://` placeholder carries, so a crop is addressable without waiting for
document-wide figure ids, including from a partial result.

This is raster work on our own render (Pillow), not PDF work; the Poppler-only rule is
untouched. A crop that fails is logged and skipped — it must never fail the page.
