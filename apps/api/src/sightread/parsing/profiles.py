"""Preset parsing profiles (docs/parsing.md § Profiles).

A profile is a model choice + coordinate prompt template + response contract + version.
Model ids are never hard-coded: each profile matches the *live* OpenRouter catalog and
picks the newest model it recognises, so a retired id can never strand a profile. When the
catalog has no match the profile simply reports `available: false`.
