"""`python -m sightread.worker` — the process that drains the job queue (docs/jobs.md).

Same codebase and same image as the API, run as its own process. One job at a time per
worker: concurrency inside a job comes from the page fan-out, and concurrency across jobs
comes from running more workers, which the FIFO `SKIP LOCKED` claim already supports.
