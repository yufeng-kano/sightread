# Jobs: queue, concurrency, dedup, retention

## Queue = PostgreSQL, nothing else

Jobs are rows in `jobs`. The worker claims work with:

```sql
UPDATE jobs SET status='running', started_at=now()
WHERE id = (
  SELECT id FROM jobs WHERE status='queued'
  ORDER BY created_at
  FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1
) RETURNING *;
```

Enqueue happens in the **same transaction** as job-row creation — no dual-write problem, no broker. If a queue swap (e.g. RabbitMQ) ever happens, it happens behind the small `queue` module interface; nothing else may know how claiming works.

The worker is the same codebase as the API, launched as its own process/container (`python -m sightread.worker`). Rendering runs in Poppler subprocesses (multi-core comes free); vision calls fan out per page with an asyncio semaphore.

One worker process runs one job at a time — concurrency inside a job is the page fan-out, concurrency across jobs is more worker processes. On `SIGTERM` the worker stops claiming; a job caught mid-run goes back to `queued` with its partial progress deleted, so a restart reparses it cleanly rather than resuming half a result.

## Concurrency caps (defaults)

- `MAX_JOBS_PER_USER` = 2 running jobs; excess `POST /v1/parse` gets 429 + `Retry-After` (fail closed, never crash). The web library's upload runs the same intake and hits the same cap, so a multi-file drop is a client-side queue that treats the 429 as back-pressure and retries ([web.md](./web.md) § Files) — the cap is not relaxed for a browser.
- `VISION_CONCURRENCY_PER_JOB` = 8 concurrent OpenRouter calls.
- `RENDER_WORKERS` = CPU count (env-overridable) concurrent Poppler subprocesses per worker.

Fairness: the claim query above is FIFO; per-user cap is enforced at claim time too (skip a queued job whose user already has `MAX_JOBS_PER_USER` running).

## Progress

Worker updates `jobs.pages_done` and `job_pages` rows as pages finish; SSE endpoints read from PG (LISTEN/NOTIFY for wakeup, poll fallback). Terminal jobs replay their final event on reconnect.

## Dedup cache

Key: `(user_id, sha256, model, connection_id, connection_base_url, profile, profile_version, pages_spec, prompt_sha256, PIPELINE_VERSION)` — `connection_id` because the same model id on two different endpoints is not the same model, and `connection_base_url` (the endpoint snapshot) because *editing* a connection's URL repoints what that id means: results parsed through the old endpoint must not answer uploads aimed at the new one. The snapshot is taken at enqueue and **reconciled at claim time**: if the connection's URL changed while the job sat queued, the worker updates the job's snapshot to the endpoint it actually calls, so the cached result is keyed by the URL that truly produced it. A key rotation alone does not invalidate the cache — same endpoint, same model, same output.

- On `POST /v1/parse`, hash while streaming to disk; if a **succeeded** job matches the full key and `force` is not set → return its result immediately (200, `meta.cached: true`), delete the fresh upload, create no job.
- **Only complete results are cache hits.** A result carrying page errors (a transient upstream failure, an unreadable page) is returned to its own job but never reused — the same upload reparses instead of replaying a degraded result forever.
- **Per-user only.** Never dedup across users: it would spend one user's OpenRouter output on another and leak that a document was parsed before.
- `force: true` always reparses (result row is replaced).
- **A retry must not buy a second parse.** The cache answers with *finished* work only, which leaves one gap: a browser cannot tell a lost response from a lost request, so it retries an upload that may already have landed, and the same bytes become a second job that bills the user's key twice for one document. `submit_parse(reuse_in_flight=True)` — asked for by the web library and by nothing else — answers such a retry with the job already queued or running for that exact key instead of starting another. The lookup is serialized by a transaction-level advisory lock on the dedup key (`hold_dedup_key`, PostgreSQL only), because reading before inserting protects a retry that arrives *after* the first upload committed but not two that overlap: both would find nothing and both would enqueue. `/v1/parse` does not do this: an API client that posts the same file twice means it, and has `force` besides.

## Retention — two layers, sweeper is the guarantee

1. **Immediate:** source file (and rendered page images) deleted the moment a job reaches `succeeded`/`failed`. After that, reparsing requires re-upload — accepted trade-off, documented here on purpose.
2. **Sweeper:** periodic task inside the worker (every 15 min) trashes anything under the upload dir older than 24 h — catches crashed jobs, abandoned uploads, bugs. The sweeper is the guarantee; immediate deletion is an optimization.

Results (markdown + metadata in PG) are kept **indefinitely** for now (low traffic); revisit when storage says otherwise. Usage rows are permanent — they are the billing history.
