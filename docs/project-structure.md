## Boundaries

- `routes/*` and `mcp/*` are thin: validation + auth + calls into `jobs`/`parsing` services. MCP owns zero business logic. `jobs/intake.py` is the shared sequence both entry points run (store → hash → probe → dedup → enqueue), so REST and MCP cannot drift apart.
- `parsing/poppler.py` is the **only** place that spawns Poppler; everything else consumes its typed results. No PDF library imports anywhere (AGPL ban, [parsing.md](./parsing.md)).
- `upstream/openrouter.py` is the only module that talks to a vision upstream (OpenRouter or a user-defined OpenAI-compatible connection) and the only one that ever holds a decrypted user key.
- `jobs/queue.py` is the only module that knows the queue is Postgres.
- Web: pages thin, logic in composables; API access through one typed client module.
