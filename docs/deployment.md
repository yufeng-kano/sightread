# Deployment

Single server, docker-compose, Caddy in front. Environments: **local** and **production** only. Production host/DNS specifics stay out of tracked files (use `.local/` notes if needed; this repo is public).

## Compose files

Compose `-f` merge semantics surprise people, so the two *full stacks* are standalone: each is
complete and readable on its own and is never merged with the other. The single exception is
`docker-compose.only-container-network.yaml`, which is an overlay **by design** — it is meaningless
on its own and exists precisely to be merged onto the production file.

**Every container is named.** `sightread-pg`, `sightread-api`, `sightread-worker`,
`sightread-web`, `sightread-caddy`, and `sightread-backup` in production — the same names in
both full stacks, so `docker logs -f sightread-worker` and `docker exec -it sightread-api sh`
are one command on a laptop and on the server instead of depending on a generated `-1` suffix
that also moves when the checkout directory is renamed. The cost, stated once: a container
name is unique per host, so the local and production stacks cannot run side by side (bring one
`down` first) and no service can be `--scale`d. Neither is something this stack does — it is
one server, one instance of each service.

### `docker-compose.yaml` — local

- Services: `pg`, `api`, `worker`, `web`, `caddy` (plain HTTP on `8080` via `deploy/caddy/Caddyfile.local`, mirroring the production routing so the built web image reaches the API on one origin). Direct ports stay exposed too: web `3000`, api `8000`, pg `${PG_PORT:-5432}` (all localhost only). **Use http://localhost:8080 for the full experience.**
- `env_file: .env` (copy from `.env.example`); `APP_ENV=local`, `AUTH_DEV_MODE=true` works here so the stack is demoable without Google credentials. Set `APP_URL`/`WEB_URL` to `http://localhost:8080` so OAuth discovery documents point at the joined origin.
- Volumes: `pgdata`, `uploads` (shared by api + worker).
- Day-to-day dev still runs `uv run uvicorn` / `pnpm dev` natively for hot reload; the compose file is for integration runs.

### `docker-compose.production.yaml` — used as `docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml up -d`

- Adds `caddy` (ports 80/443, automatic TLS via ACME); `api`/`web` not published on the host, reachable only on the compose network.
- `APP_ENV=production` (dev login hard-disabled), `AUTH_DEV_MODE` absent.
- Volumes: `pgdata`, `uploads`, `figures` (stored figure crops — durable result data, [parsing.md](./parsing.md) § Figure crops), `caddy_data` (certs), `caddy_config`.
- Backups: a `backup` service (the `postgres:16` image) loops once a day into `./backups` (mounted, gitignored), keeping the newest seven of each: `pg_dump --format=custom` for the database, and a `tar.gz` of the `figures` volume (mounted read-only) — a restored database with the crops gone would keep every figure's metadata while losing its image, and the sources that produced them are long deleted. The two are **published as a same-stamp pair, or not at all**: both are written as temporaries and moved into place only when both succeeded, so the newest dump always has its matching figures archive. The schedule and the rotation are a visible shell loop in the compose file on purpose. Restore is `pg_restore -d sightread <dump>` plus untarring the same-stamp figures archive back into the volume (`tar -xzf figures-<stamp>.tar.gz -C /data` inside a container mounting it); test both before launch. Leaving managed platforms means backups are ours now.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` has no default here: the stack refuses to start without one. Migrations run from the `api` container's start command (`alembic upgrade head`), and the worker gates on the api's **healthcheck** (`/healthz`), not merely on its container starting — healthy means migrations finished and the server is up, so a worker can never claim a queued job against a half-migrated schema, bill the user's key, and then fail on a missing column.

### `docker-compose.only-container-network.yaml` — production behind a front proxy

For hosts where something else already owns `:443` — typically an SNI router fronting several
unrelated stacks. Merged onto the production file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml -f docker-compose.only-container-network.yaml up -d
```

- Drops Caddy's published ports (`ports: !reset []`) so the whole stack claims **no host port at
  all**; Caddy still listens on 443 *inside* the container. `!reset` on `ports` needs a recent
  Compose (verified on 2.40.1).
- Joins Caddy to the external network `proxy` with the alias `sightread-caddy` — that alias is how
  the front router reaches it, and it is prefixed because `caddy` alone would collide with every
  other stack on a shared network. Create the network once: `docker network create proxy`. `api`,
  `worker` and `pg` stay on the default network and remain unreachable from it.
- **Caddy still terminates TLS and still owns its certificate.** The front router must do SNI
  passthrough (raw TCP, no TLS termination). Terminating TLS upstream is not supported here: it
  breaks this stack's ACME, and the certificate is deliberately the service's own responsibility.
- Port 80 is not published either, so the HTTP-01 challenge cannot reach Caddy. The Caddyfile
  disables it and validates with TLS-ALPN-01 (RFC 8737) over the 443 that is passed through, so the
  front router only has to forward 443.
- The overlay carries no host-specific values — the domain still comes from `DOMAIN` in `.env`.
  It is tracked on purpose: anyone fronting this stack with their own proxy needs it.

## Caddy routing (`deploy/caddy/Caddyfile`)

```text
<domain> {
  tls { issuer acme { disable_http_challenge } }   # validate over 443 (TLS-ALPN-01), never :80
  request_body { max_size 128MB }        # keep in sync with UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES
  @api path /healthz /v1/* /api/* /oauth/* /mcp /mcp/* /.well-known/*
  handle @api { reverse_proxy api:8000 }
  handle      { reverse_proxy web:3000 }
}
```

`/healthz` is listed first so an external monitor hits the API rather than the Nuxt 404 page. Uploads and SSE go straight through Caddy to FastAPI — never through the Nuxt/Node server. Disable proxy buffering for SSE routes; long-lived connections need generous idle timeouts.

As built: the domain comes from `{$DOMAIN}` and the ACME contact from `{$ACME_EMAIL}` (both in `.env`, passed to the caddy service), the API proxy sets `flush_interval -1` (no response buffering, for SSE and MCP streams) and 30-minute read/write timeouts.

Certificates are always this stack's own: the site block carries an explicit `tls { issuer acme { disable_http_challenge } }`, so validation is TLS-ALPN-01 over 443 and never HTTP-01 over 80. That holds for both deployments — standalone, where Caddy publishes 80 and 443 itself, and behind a front proxy, where only a passed-through 443 reaches it. Port 80 is therefore only ever an HTTP→HTTPS convenience, never a dependency.

## Environment variables (`.env.example` / `.env.production.example` are the authoritative lists)

| Var | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| `APP_ENV` | `local` / `production` |
| `APP_URL` | public origin, used in OAuth metadata + OIDC redirect |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+asyncpg://...` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | sessions + HKDF root for OpenRouter-key encryption; generate long random |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | OIDC |
| `AUTH_DEV_MODE` | local only; absent from `.env.production.example` |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`, `PAGE_CAP`, `MAX_JOBS_PER_USER`, `VISION_CONCURRENCY_PER_JOB`, `RENDER_WORKERS` | defaults in [api.md](./api.md) / [jobs.md](./jobs.md) |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | `/data/uploads` in containers |
| `PG_PORT` | local compose only: host port for `pg` (default 5432); change it when that port is taken |
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` | the `pg` container's credentials; the password is required in production |
| `DOMAIN` / `ACME_EMAIL` | production only: the host Caddy serves, and the Let's Encrypt contact address |

Two standalone example files, same reasoning as the compose files: `.env.example` is local,
`.env.production.example` is production, and neither is a diff against the other. Deploying means
copying the production one and filling it in — never carrying the local `.env` to a server.
`AUTH_DEV_MODE` deliberately does not appear in the production example at all.

Secrets live in `.env` (gitignored) on the server; tracked files carry placeholders only. Never print secret values — only whether one exists.

Google OAuth client (production): the authorized redirect URI is `https://<domain>/api/auth/callback`, and the authorized origin is `https://<domain>`. Nothing else in the app needs registering with Google — the connector flow uses this app's own authorization server.

## Release flow (initial)

`git pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml up -d --build` on the server (append
`-f docker-compose.only-container-network.yaml` on hosts with a front proxy — and keep appending it,
since leaving it off republishes 80/443 and collides with whatever owns them). Tagged releases/CI can come later; keep root `package.json` version bumped per SemVer when tagging starts.
